 Music My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why Got out of bed at all The morning rain clouds up my window And I can't see at all And even if I could it'll all be grey Put your picture on my wall It reminds me that it's not so bad It's not so bad Music I drank too much last night Got bills to pay My head just feels in pain I missed the bus and they'll be Held today I'm late for work again And even if I'm there They'll all imply That I might not last the day And then you call me And it's not so bad It's not so bad And I want to thank you For giving me the best day of my life And all just to be with you Is giving me the best day of my life Music Pushed the door, I'm home at last And I'm soaking through and through And then you handed me a towel And all I see is you And even if my house falls down now I wouldn't have a clue Because you're near me And I want to thank you For giving me the best day of my life And all just to be with you Is giving me the best day of my life And I want to thank you For giving me the best day of my life And all just to be with you Is giving me the best day of my life
